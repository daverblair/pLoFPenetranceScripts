# Machine Learning Penetrance Prediction Model Training

These scripts train the machine learning penetrance prediction models for the three variant classes, storing the models for future use. 

Step 1-CreateTraining_ValidationDatasets.py: This script creates the dataframes for model training from the global penetrance table and the disease-specific carrier tables (which store all the features.)


Step 2-Trains the machine learning models. There are three scripts, one for each variant class.
