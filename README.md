# Reduced Penetrance is Common Among Predicted Loss-of-Function Variants and is Likely Driven by Residual Allelic Activity

This GitHub project contains the scripts used to generate the results from the manuscript entitled "Reduced Penetrance is Common Among Predicted Loss-of-Function Variants and is Likely Driven by Residual Allelic Activity." The order for the analytical steps is indicated by the number before each sub-directory name. The Auxillary_Data/Functions are referenced by some of the other scripts. Each sub-directory also includes a ReadMe describing how the scripts should be used. There are also additional comments in the scripts themselves. 


Note, these scripts can be applied to either biobank provided that the data is processed according to the instructions described in the scripts. Path names will need to be edited according to the computing instance/architecture being used for the analysis. Genomic data preprocessing will also need to be performed prior to using these scripts using each tools available for each biobank.
